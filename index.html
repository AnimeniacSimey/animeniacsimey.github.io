            I took that fella round back to the waterhole<br> 
            I turned that critter to dust and it's audible<br>
            I turned your 10-gallon hat to some particles<br>
            Ain't never read what they wrote in my articles<br>
            I'm so illiterate<br>
            I can't even read a little bit<br> 
            I keep a banjo on my hip and I diddle it<br>
            Middle kid, I got some siblings<br>
            Rat eat the scrap on the floor and the nibblings<br>
